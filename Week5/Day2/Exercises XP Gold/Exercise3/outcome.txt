setTimeout fires at t = 5000 ms

5000: ==PARALLEL with await Promise.all==
5000: starting slow promise
5000: starting fast promise
6000: fast promise is done
6000: fast
7000: slow promise is done
7000: slow

Two async IIFEs start concurrently; Promise.all awaits both.
Each IIFE logs its resolved value after its own await.
Total duration: 2â€¯s (slowest promise) after start, i.e., 7000 ms overall.
