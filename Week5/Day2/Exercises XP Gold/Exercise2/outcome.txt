Timeline (ms relative to setTimeout at t=1000):

1000: ==CONCURRENT START with Promise.all==
1000: starting slow promise
1000: starting fast promise
2000: fast promise is done
3000: slow promise is done
3000: slow
3000: fast

Promise.all waits for *all* promises to resolve before its .then runs,
so logs from .then appear only after the slow (3â€‘second) promise completes.
