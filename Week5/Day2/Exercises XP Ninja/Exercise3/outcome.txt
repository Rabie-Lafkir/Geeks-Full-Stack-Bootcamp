setTimeout fires at 5000 ms:

5000: ==PARALLEL with await Promise.all==
5000: starting slow promise
5000: starting fast promise
6000: fast promise is done
6000: fast
7000: slow promise is done
7000: slow

Both async IIFEs start simultaneously and each logs its resolved value;
await Promise.all waits until both complete (7 s total).
