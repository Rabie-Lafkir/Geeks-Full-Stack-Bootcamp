Timeline (ms offset from setTimeout trigger at 1000â€¯ms):

1000: ==CONCURRENT START with Promise.all==
1000: starting slow promise
1000: starting fast promise
2000: fast promise is done
3000: slow promise is done
3000: slow
3000: fast

Promise.all waits for both promises; logs of messages occur after the slow promise resolves.
